# Eight Puzzle Solver
Authors: [Linda Ghunaim](https://github.com/lindgh) and [Advithi Kethidi](https://github.com/AKethidi)

In this project, we implemented an A* search algorithm with three different heuristics to solve an eight puzzle. The implementation takes an object-oriented design and allows for variation of the eight puzzle through user input.

## What We Learned
- Design of a generalized search algorithm
- Implementation of different heuristics (Uniform Cost, Misplaced Tile, Euclidean Distance) to understand the importance of a good heuristic on an AI search problem
- The impact of a heuristic on space and time complexity
